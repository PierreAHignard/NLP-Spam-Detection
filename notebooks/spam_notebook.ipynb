    "\n",
    "## 4.1 Understanding Tokenization Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "We will take the simplest approach possible: our input features will be the most frequent words and their frequencies. The idea is that the words that appear frequently in a document are characteristic of its content, and thus of its spam-ness.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **CountVectorizer** class of scikit-learn will do exactly this for us. It first counts word frequencies across *all* messages, in order to find the overall most frequent ones. Then, it counts the occurrences of these most frequent words in each message, computing a frequency vector per message, where each dimension of the vector corresponds to a frequent word.\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, what does *most frequent word* mean? We will define a threshold, which we will call the **number of features**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, what is a word? *Word* is not a term from linguistics, it has no scientific definition.\n",
    "* Is \"hazelnuts\" one word, two words, or three words? \"hazel\", \"nut\", and \"-s\" are what linguists call *morphemes*: the elementary units of meaning, but in common language \"hazelnuts\" would be considered as a single word.\n",
    "* Is \"$12.50\" a single word? It consists of a currency symbol and a rational number.\n",
    "* Is \"Joe's\" one or two words?\n",
    "* etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "A pragmatic choice is not to use the term \"word\" but rather the term \"token\". A token can be whatever unit into which we decide to split our input text. We call **tokenization** the process of splitting a text into tokens. **Beware: the choice of splitting rule will determine the performance of downstream tasks.** CountVectorizer has a **token_pattern** parameter that takes a regular expression as an input string. Instead of blindly trusting whatever default tokenization method offered by CountVectorizer, let us define our own rule. A few possibilities:\n",
    "* split by whitespace;\n",
    "* split by whitespace or punctuation;\n",
    "* keep only tokens that contain letters or digits;\n",
    "* keep only tokens of length > X (where you choose X);\n",
    "* etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, it is common to perform additional preprocessing to the input text, always depending on the requirements of the downstream task:\n",
    "* in some cases, converting to all-lowercase may improve results (e.g. \"WIN\" and \"win\" are collapsed into a single feature), but it may also result in losing useful information (is all-caps characteristic of spam?).\n",
    "* In bag-of-word models, removing so-called *stop words* helps eliminate frequent grammatical words that bear little relevant meaning (e.g. articles, pronouns, modal verbs, prepositions). Beware, as models that rely on syntax (i.e. phrases) do need grammar words: stop words should not be eliminated systematically.\n",
    "* The presence of numbers (e.g. phone numbers, money amounts) in the text may be an important feature to detect spam. However, each distinct number will be considered by CountVectorizer as a different token, and as phone numbers (sums of money, etc.) tend not to repeat across messages, the classifier will not be able to generalize over them. You may implement generalisation manually by detecting tokens that only contain digits and replacing them by a general \"<NUMBER>\" token, for example.     \n",
    "\n",
